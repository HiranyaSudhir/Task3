Implementing a support vector machine algorithm to classify the images of cats and dogs using kaggle dataset
Title: Dog vs Cat Image Classification using SVM
Overview:
Developed a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project involved grayscale image preprocessing, resizing, flattening image data, and model training using a linear kernel. Achieved high accuracy by applying classical ML techniques on visual data, without deep learning.

Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, SVM, NumPy, Matplotlib

Key Features:

Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing to 64x64)

Manual label encoding for binary classification

SVM classifier with linear kernel

Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report

Outcome: Built a lightweight image classification pipeline using traditional ML techniques for educational and experimental purposes.
